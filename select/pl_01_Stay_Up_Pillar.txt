Pack a bag go let the world know how you feel
about it
Hit the party let the people scream and shout
about it
No doubt about it no reason for you to pout
about it
If you don't get it then you probably live your
life without it.
So get it it and take a second just to think it
through
It's not a secret you're on schedule for a
rendezvous
But who knew the 'Who's Who of Voodoo'
Would be you the day you get your verdict asking
for a redo
[Chorus]
Get up, Get up we never get down
[KJ-52] We be seekin' freaks out from the
underground
Stay up, Stay up we never let down
[KJ-52] We keep it rockin' 'til you all come
around
Ready or not here we come, come to seek you out
Cause you can only hide for so long in the
underground
Until you're found and you scream aloud in the
crowd
That you're down and you're never turning back
around
So shut down the ways we'll call the days of old
And get down with the freaks that are livin'
bold
Stay up we livin' life fortississimo
KJ we get the freaks gotta let 'em know
[KJ-52]
Now excuse me
Now what I speak is for my freaks and when I
come forth
And I get down like I'm jumpin' off the eighth
floor
What's the dealy for realy what you ashamed for
You're the reason that He came for and His blood
poured
So behold He stands at the door and just knocks
But you be standin' at the door with the door
locked
So it's a sure shot that in the whole spot and
whole
Lotta y'all need to take heed the words that we
drop
